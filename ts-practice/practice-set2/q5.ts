// What is type inference? Show an example where TypeScript automatically infers the type.

// type inference means that the compiler senses the type of the variable by it's own. 

let var1 = 2;
console.log(typeof var1);

// and we can't assign the other type data to it.
// var1 = 'hello'; // shows the error>
